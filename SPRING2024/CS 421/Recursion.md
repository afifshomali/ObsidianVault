Multiplying by 2 can be done with a left shift so it doesn't take as much computation as regular multiplication

For 4, all of nothing is still true, so it still counts as a list of strings even though it is an empty list

This adds a second copy of each element to the list

## Forward Recursion
![[Pasted image 20240201100624.png]]
We first make the recursive call, then we process the results from the recursive calls
