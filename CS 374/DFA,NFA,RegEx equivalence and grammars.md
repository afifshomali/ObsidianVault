[[Deterministic-finite-automata(DFA)|DFA]]s, [[Non-Deterministic Finite Automata|NFA]]s & [[Regular Expressions]] are all equivalent

Lets look at how to convert between them:

[[Regex to NFA]] also know as [[Regex to NFA|Thompsons]] Algorithm.
[[NFA to DFA]]
[[DFAs to RegExs]]
[[NFAs to RegExs]] 
[[RegExs to DFAs]]
