A string/word over $\sum$ is a **finite sequence** of symbols over $\sum$.

For example:
	''`011011`''
	''`string`''

**Concatenation:**
	$x \cdot y = xy$  

**Length:**
	$|w|$ = length
	$|101| = 3$
	$|\epsilon| = 0$

For an integer $n \geq 0$, $\sum^n$ is the set of all strings over $\sum$ of length $n$

$\sum^*$ is the set of all strings of all lengths including the empty string
$*$ is the Kleene Star

$\epsilon$ is the empty string, not a set
$\emptyset$ is the empty set
{$\epsilon$} is the set containing the empty string, it is a set not a string

Important for working with strings:
- [[Concatenation & Its Properties]] 
- [[Substrings, Prefixes, Suffixes]]
- [[String Exponent]]

**Questions:**
Let $\sum =$ {0, 1}
- $\sum^0 =$ {$\epsilon$} which is all strings of length 0
- There are $2^n$ in $\sum^n$
- If $|u| = 2$ & $|v| = 3$ then $|u \cdot v| = 5$
