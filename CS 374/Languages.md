How do we formulate Languages? We need to have some Rules

Start with:![[Alphabet]] 
Next we have [[Strings]] which we can make out of the characters from a language.

**Definition:**
A language L is a set of strings over $\sum$. In other words L $\subseteq \sum^*$.
Standard [[Set]] operations apply to languages since they can be consider as sets.

---
Languages can be divided into a hierarchy called the _Chomsky Hierarchy_
This represent all possible problems with the stuff outside the ovals representing incomputable problems.

We will start with [[Regular Languages]].
