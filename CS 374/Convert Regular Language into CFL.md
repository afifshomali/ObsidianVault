With [[Regular Languages]] we have a restriction on for the [[Context Free Languages|CFG]] we can generate. As we see the terminals can only appear on one side of the variable in the production result. So we can't have $V \rightarrow tVt$ in a regular language like we can with context free languages. 

We also see that we can't have multiple variables in the production result, we can only have one.
