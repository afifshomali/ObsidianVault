It's like a Binomial Distribution but with multiple possible outcomes instead of just two. 
For example, the categories of methods that students arrive to school with would have multiple categories such as: Bus, Car, Bike, Walk, Other

In the example mentioned, the "Other" category is a redundant if we know the number of occurrences for all the other categories & the total number of trials.

The [[Binomial distribution]] is a special case of the Multinomial Distribution when $c=2$ 
The marginal Distribution of each $n_j$ is a Binomial Distribution

The Multinomial Distribution is also connected to the [[Poisson distribution]] in an interesting way, see [[Connection Between Poisson & Multinomial Distributions]].
