W is a "weight" matrix. It is diagonal with the $w_i$ as its elements
![[Pasted image 20231006113524.png]]
Use chain rule to calculate the first part $w_i$ then can square that term & divide it by Variance of $Y_i$ 
We see that $w_i$ is dependent on the parameter $\pi_i$ so we need to use the estimate to get an estimated $W$ matrix
