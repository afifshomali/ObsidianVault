A variables level of measurement is used to determine which [[Statistical methods]] can be used to analyze it.

**Hierarchy of Variables:**
[[Ratio Quantitative Variables|Ratio]] > [[Interval Quantitative Variable|Interval]] > [[Ordinal Categorical Variables|Ordinal]] > [[Nominal Categorical Variables|Nominal]]

Statistical methods applied lower on the hierarchy can be applied to variables higher up. For example a [[Ordinal Categorical Variables|Ordinal]] variable can be analyzed as a [[Nominal Categorical Variables|Nominal]] but doesn't other way around doesn't apply.

We can apply Ordinal & Nominal methods to analyze Interval & Ratio variables by grouping those quantitative variables into small groups.

**Example**:
Years of Education as a quantitative grouped into 3 categories: 
*  0-10 Years
* 10-12 Years
* >12 Years

It's Important to make the distinction between:
* Continuous vs Discrete Variables
* Quantitative vs Qualitative Variables
