Every row comes from a binomial distribution & we assume the rows are independent 
Want to whether $\pi_i$ s are the same or different, if they are the same, then we can say that $X$ doesn't really have an influence on what the value of $Y$

Use Dummy variables to code our categorical values, We only need $i-1$ because it is redundant to include either the first or the last row. We either the first or last row to be the reference level.

$logit(\pi_i) - logit(\pi_1) = \alpha + \beta_i - \alpha = \beta_i$ 
The log odds ratio is $log(\dfrac{Odds(\tilde{x_i})}{Odds(\tilde{x_1})}) = \beta_i$ ,so odds ratio is $e^{\beta_i}$ 
Similarly, $logit(\pi_i) = \alpha + \beta_i$ and $logit(\pi_{i'}) = \alpha + \beta_{i'}$ 
Then subtract these two we get $logit(\pi_i) - logit(\pi_{i'}) = \beta_i - \beta_{i'}$ 
Then take exponent of both sides & we get log odds ratio is $e^{\beta_i - \beta_{i'}}$

If $y_i = 0$ or  $y_i = n_i$ then we will have $\pi_i = 0$ or $\pi_i = 1$ so logit will not exist.

We can also add an interaction term to this model.

### R Example:
![[Pasted image 20231025102703.png]]
Here we have a $I$ x $2$ table where $I = 5$. Present + Absent will be the total number of trials.

Deviance residuals are 0 so we have a saturated model, all residuals are equal to zero.
Here our reference category is "<1" but it would make more sense to have 0 drinks as our reference category but R automatically chose "<1" to be the reference

X is not a invertible matrix since the first column is a linear combination of the rest of the columns in the matrix.
fitted gives us $\hat{\pi_1}$,$\hat{\pi_2}$ ... $\hat{\pi_I}$

Degrees of freedom is 4 because we coded in 4 Dummy variables
![[Pasted image 20231025102752.png]]
When we use a Pearson test we have a significant p-value unlike the LRT 
![[Pasted image 20231025102805.png]]
Use Drinks with scores as ordinal predictor which is quantitative, & we still see a non significant predictor using LRT
