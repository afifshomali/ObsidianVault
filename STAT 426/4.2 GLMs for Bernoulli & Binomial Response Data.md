For a [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli]] Response Variable we have:

We see that the variance is a function of the expected value.

The y-axis represents $\pi(x)$ for changing values of $\beta$

### Psych Data R example(Bernoulli):

They are the Estimate column from the output of the R code above
![[Pasted image 20231002131540.png]]
Can just sum each of the $x_i$ s for each row & make a new explanatory variable to use.

The $Pr(>|z|)$ is testing $H_o: \beta = 0$ vs $H_a : \beta \neq 0$ . 
The Dispersion parameter ($\phi = 1$) works to help us account for if the variance doesn't equal the mean, if we set it to above 1 we can account for overdispersion, since it is set to 1 we are assuming no overdispersion in this dataset.
Deviance works similar to Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) meaning the higher the deviance, the worse the fit of the model.
For the Null Deviance, that is the deviance with just the intercept and we are testing that against the Residual Deviance which is the deviance of the model we fitted.
As we see the deviance drops significantly so we can see our model is better at predicting than just the model with an intercept.
AIC also measures how good a model fits, a lower AIC means a better fit

Since we have logit link function, we are plotting against the log of a Response variable. This means as total score increases the chance of having illness decreases.

### Binomial + Example:
To use [[Binomial distribution|Binomial]] we can have [[Grouped data]] if we have repeated observations that have the same values for all their explanatory variables

We can use the binomial when have a 2x2 table too:

There is also other links, here we can see the [[Probit regression]]:
