The models in this class resembles [[Regression Models]] with continuous response variables, but can have a [[Binomial distribution|Binomial]], [[Multinomial distribution|Multinomial]] or [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] distribution instead of the [[Normal Distribution]].

Featured Models:
- [[Logistic regression]] Model for binary responses and assume a [[Binomial distribution]]
- [[Generalization of the Logistic Regression Model]] to multi-category responses (Nominal & Ordinal), assume a [[Multinomial distribution]]
- [[Loglinear Model]]s for count data, and assume a [[Poisson distribution]]
- [[Generalization to multivariate categorical responses]] & representation of [[Associations]] and [[interactions]] among variables 
- Models for repeated categorical responses arising from [[Longitudinal Data]]

Each of the data points here are a "count random variable"
If we have an upper limit we can assume a [[Multinomial distribution]]
If we don't have an upper limit we can assume a [[Poisson distribution]]
