4 levels/categories, the only thing that is varying here is the Hardwood Concentrations.

IQR plots for each category, one-way Anova assumes all samples from Normal Distributions and all Samples have same variance

## One-Way ANOVA
![[Pasted image 20240208151326.png]]
Each group/ level of predictor has a an $\alpha_i$ that changes the global mean $\mu$ by some amount, can be higher or lower.
![[Pasted image 20240208151415.png]]
This tests if having $\alpha_i$ has any effect on finding the value of the response.
