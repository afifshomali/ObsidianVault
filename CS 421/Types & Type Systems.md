Won't access data that doesn't ask to it, so we don't get segmentation faults because of the type checker & compile time code generation

Can imply theorem, as in if you have type a that returns b then a implies b.

So that before we perform an operation, we make sure that we can actually perform the operation on the object, e.g. adding two integers and making sure that one is not a float.

Need to know it before running the code, we can't be making inferences at runtime
![[Pasted image 20240220100555 1.png]]
Can remove the runtime check for x being an integer or some other type. But, divide by zero still has to be runtime.

Whatever environment you have you will always know that true has type bool, 9 has type int, etc. etc.

If x in $\Gamma$ then we check that x has the correct type

Show that both have compatible types, so adding two integers or doing a cons operation on an element and a list.

It is a relation operator so it is the outermost operations so we use the Binary Rule.
