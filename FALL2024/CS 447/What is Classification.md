Example of classification would be spam detection where we want to take emails and put them into one of two groups

- Its important to have generalization, so even if our classifier hasn't seen an email it can correctly classify it as junk or not
- The classifier needs to adapt & change based on the feedback/supervision it receives
- We can even generalize the spam detection further and include multiple classes, like "work", "school", "Spam", this is called a multiclass classification tasks
