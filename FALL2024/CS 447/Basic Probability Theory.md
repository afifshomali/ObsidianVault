## Probability Models
---
- To build the probability model we need to
		1. Define the model
		2. Estimate the model parameters which is training/learning
Probability models have independence assumptions most of the time
	- This happens even if two variables are not independent
	- Treating variables as independent allows us to reduce the number of parameters to estimate
	- Models without independence assumptions have a lot more parameters
	- But since independence assumptions are often incorrect, the models will be incorrect as well they can assign probability mass to events that cannot occur
