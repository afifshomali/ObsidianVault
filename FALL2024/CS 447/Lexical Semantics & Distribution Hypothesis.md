- What about a word like "bar" which is very ambiguous
	- Could mean a a place to get drinks
	- Could mean a bar of something, like metal
	- Could also mean to prevent someone from doing something 

- NLP uses 2 different types of methods to capture meaning
	- Lexicographic tradition, aims to capture information represented in lexicons, dictionaries etc.
	- Distributional Tradition, aims to capture the meaning of words based on a large amount of raw text
