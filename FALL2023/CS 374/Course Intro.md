Course looks into:
	- Computational Complexity: Can it be solved?
	- Algorithms: How fast can we solve it?
	- Limits of Computation: If it cannot be solved, is it similar to some other problems?

We don't always have good algorithms for a problem, but if we group them together, finding a solution/better algorithm for one lets us solve other problems in that group
