### Multiplying Numbers:
Start with our grade school method:

This algorithm is not very efficient, but we try to add divide & conquer:

But this is still no efficient so instead we can use:

However people have found even faster algorithms & it is proposed that there is a $O(nlogn)$ algorithm for multiplication:
