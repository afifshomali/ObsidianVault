A set is a list without any repeating elements, there are variety of operations that we can perform on sets.

## Set Concatenation:

For Sets $A$, $B$ the concatenation of $A$, $B$ is $AB =$ {$xy | x \epsilon A, y \epsilon B$} 

**Example:**

$XY =$ {ECE340, ECE374, CS340, CS374}

## Union, Intersect & Difference:

For Sets $A$, $B$, 
* Their Union is $A \cup B$ 
* Their Intersection is $A \cap B$
* Their Difference is $A \backslash B$  or $A - B$ 

## Complement:

For language $A \subseteq \sum^*$ the complement of A is $\bar A = \sum^* \backslash A$

## Set Exponents:

$\sum^*$ does not have any [[Strings]] of infinite length since all strings must be finite length.
