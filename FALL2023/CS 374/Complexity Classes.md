### Overview of Complexity Classes:
![[Pasted image 20231107130050.png]]
PSpace is polynomial space, EXP is exponential time 
NP are problems that can be verified in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine 
Deterministic + Polynomial time is NP verification
co-NP is problems that are decidability problems that focus on answering no
NP-Hard are harder problems than other NP problems
NPC are np complete problems, Hard problems with no efficient solution
