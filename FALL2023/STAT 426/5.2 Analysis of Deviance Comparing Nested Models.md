We know this LRT statistic will always be greater than 0 since the negative sign will cancel out the negative inside the parenthesis. The deviance of the model with less parameters must be less than the model it is nested in.

Effective Parameters is the number of parameters we actually need to estimate since the last parameter is a function of the other parameters. We get $df_1 - df_0$. We want to reject $H_0$ when the difference in between the Deviances is big enough.

For each coefficient we test: $H_0: \beta_i = 0$

The bottom right entry is the $Var(\hat{\beta_4})$

hsfit0 is the model nested in hsfit
$H_0: \beta_2 = \beta_3 = 0$ is what we test OR $H_0:$ Model 1 is correct
The df is the difference of degrees of freedom: $df(model_1) - df(model_2)$ and the Deviance value of 0.94 is the difference in the deviance between the two models
