We will mostly focus [[Maximum likelihood estimation]]. Assuming certain regularity conditions, the properties of the maximum likelihood estimators are:
- Large sample normal distributions
- Asymptotically consistent (converge to the population value)
- Asymptotically efficient (lower variance than other estimators)

We can use the [[Wald test and Wald confidence interval|Wald Test]] to test for a null hypothesis to see if the maximum likelihood estimate is a certain value.
