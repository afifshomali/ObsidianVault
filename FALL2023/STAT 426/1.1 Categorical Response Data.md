A variable that that can take on one of a limited number & usually fixed number of possible values, assigning each individual observation to a particular group or category  

This class will focus on Categorical [[Response Variables | Dependent/Response Variables]] but our [[Explanatory Variables | Independent/Explanatory Variables]] can be of any type as in ordinary [[Regression Models]], so we can have [[Quantitative Variables]] as explanatory ones.

**Examples:**
	- Levels of Income
	- Level of Education
	- Level of Satisfaction
	- Level of Motivation
	- Motives for traveling 

Not all these will end up following a [[Normal Distribution]], but we can use a [[Transformations | Transformation]] to make the Distribution follow those properties, as an example the [[Log Transformation]] which is Monotonous meaning it preserves the order of numbers.

Some of these examples have a natural ordering, such as Education or Satisfaction, but some do not such as Motives for traveling. This is where we separate categorical variables into two [[Nominal Categorical Variables |Nominal]] and [[Ordinal Categorical Variables |Ordinal]].

There are also different [[Levels of Measurements]] which include [[Nominal Categorical Variables|Nominal]] and [[Ordinal Categorical Variables|Ordinal]].

There are many types of [[Models for Categorical Responses]]
