Also know as the Logit model it is when we have our left side for the equation be logit function or the log odds function which is $ln(\dfrac{\pi}{1-\pi})$ . We let the log odds of our response variable be a linear combination of one or more of our predictors.

If $w^T x$ is larger, then the exponential will be close to zero so the sigmoid function will be close to 1

$\sigma (0) = 0.5$

This flips the sigmoid along the vertical axis

If scaling by number greater than 1, we make the function "steeper"
If scaling by number less that one, we make the function "flatter"
