An [[Interval Quantitative Variable|Interval]] variable where ratios are valid (presence of absolute zero)

Also <u>No Negative Values Allowed</u> so Temperature in Kelvin works as an interval variable, but Temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius won't work 

Other examples include Distance traveled or Time since we can use ratios like "half the time" or "twice the distance"
