## R Example:
![[Pasted image 20231027100942.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231027100952.png]]
The base line category is absorbed by the intercept, we see that the darker the color, the log odds are decreasing.

$e^{-\hat\beta_i - (-\hat\beta_{i-1})}$  for comparing two categorical levels that are sequential

By adding scoring we made it an ordinal variable and we have a variable that is significant.
## Matrix Vector Formulation:
![[Pasted image 20231027102129.png]]
$\eta$ is a linear combination of our predictors. 
If we have a [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] the we will have $log(\mu(x_i))$ instead of the logit

This omits some constant because the constant does not depend on the parameter so we can just use the kernel of the log-likelihood function.
