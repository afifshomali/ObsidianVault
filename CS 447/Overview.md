## What the class covers
---
- What is NLP?
	Core Tasks 
	Datasets 
	Evaluation Metrics
- How does NLP work?
	 Models
	 Algorithms
	 Representations 
- Why is NLP Hard?
	- Linguistic concepts & phenomena 

## NLP is necessary to:
---
- analyze text automatically at scale like news, social media, search queries
- translate text automatically between languages
- communicate naturally systems and devices, like smart devices
- generate text automatically at scale

NLP is an increasingly important area
NLP is far from solved
NLP requires a broad mix of knowledge
	- What is a natural language
	- What about natural languages are challenging for computers
	- What kind of data, algorithms, and machine learning approaches can we use

## What about LLMs
---
- LLMs are rapidly transforming the state of the art in NLP
- Better models come out faster than classes get updated
- LLMs are big money, NLP is a multi-billion dollar industry
- Frontier LLMs are poorly understood, model size/architecture, training regime/data not publicly known
- LLMs have not solved NLP

## Teaching in the NLP in the LLM era
---
- Anyone can use chatbots/AI tools but not everyone understand how NLP or LLMs work
- LLMs are an important part of NLP
- NLP is not just an LLM class
- Basic Principles are known and how LLMs are trained
- Don't know specific data, size of architecture, how much data

## Focus of this class
---
- Want to identify the structure and meaning of words, sentences, text, conversations
- Mainly deal with language analysis & understanding rather than production/generation 
- We focus on fundamental concepts, methods & models
	- Data (natural language)
	- Representation: vectors, grammars, automata
	- Tasks: analysis, generation, translation
	- Models, neural models, statistical models
